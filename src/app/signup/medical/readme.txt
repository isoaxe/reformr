This route contains a page for each medical question. The naming convention is as follows:

wmXX
w => Weight loss quiz. This is to allow for other quizzes related to more products in the future.
m => Medical quiz. This differentiates it from the screening quiz and other quiz types that may be introduced in the future.
XX => An integer beginning at 01. Increments with each new question.

Current question list:
Question 01 => wm01-what-motivates-you
Question 02 => wm02-when-last-ideal-weight
Question 03 => wm03-how-weight-affects
Question 04 => wm04-freq-loss-of-control
Question 05 => wm05-extent-of-food-domination
Question 06 => wm06-weight-loss-techniques
Question 07 => wm07-lasting-results

These are the initial ordering of questions. If any get moved around they will be updated in the list above so we have a reference. If any more get added, the numbering system will continue to increment. This will be the case even if numbers before are 'freed up' due to the removal of a question that was previously included.
