These are a few notes to consider when working with webhooks.

The two webhooks that we currently have are as follows:
payments processing: https://reformr.vercel.app/api/payments/recurring
ID verification: https://reformr.vercel.app/api/identity/results

Commands used for CLI testing:
invoice listener: stripe listen --events invoice.paid,invoice.payment_failed --forward-to localhost:3000/api/payments/recurring
invoice trigger: stripe trigger invoice.paid
identity listener: stripe listen --events identity.verification_session.canceled,identity.verification_session.processing,identity.verification_session.verified,identity.verification_session.requires_input --forward-to localhost:3000/api/identity/results
identity trigger: stripe trigger identity.verification_session.canceled

Note: Instructions executed from the UI during development (e.g. manually filling in credit card details as a customer would do) can be logged via the listeners above. They're not just for CLI triggers. Responses will also logged to the Stripe dashboard, but these will be for the production webhook.
