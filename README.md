# Reformr

A web app for Reformr, a New Zealand-based healthcare company focused on helping women lose weight with prescription medication.

## MVP v1

The version of the platform in place before development commenced is referred to as MVP v1. It is a drag-and-drop frontend hosted on Squarespace using [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com) to capture customer data in one large quiz. Responses are saved to a MS Word document on Google Drive for doctors to access and edit. A meeting is scheduled with that doctor using [Calendly](https://calendly.com). Following the meeting, payment is made via a Stripe integration that does not achieve the full desired functionality (no identity verification). There are about 10 paying customers at this point (early October 2023).
